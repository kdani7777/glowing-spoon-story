One beautiful summer day on a farm in Kansas, Alfred was milking his cows.
It had been a long day full of monotonous work. Nothing out of the ordinary
had happened and he was simply tired. As the sun went down, Alfred left some
food and water for his animals before he went inside to have dinner. In the
distance, there was a loud rumble.

There were two goats. The two goats tried to cross a narrow bridge over there.
They moved forward but niether of them wanted to make way for the other. They
started fighting, and all of sudden, the bridge is broken.

Two goats were shocked and fall into small river. Alfred heard the sound and come to the broken bridge.
He saw his goats struggled in the river and howled. Without thinking, he quickly took off his shirt
and jumped into cold river. The river flow siwftly and Alfred was hard to get close with his goats.
He thought, "After I back to the shore, I will punish this two reckless goats. I will bake them!!!"

Alfred was a good swimmer and was able to make it to shore with his goats riding on his back.
Looking at his bridge, he realized that he would need to have it rebuilt wider in the future.
Frustrated, he sent both of his goats home and had an extra glass of wine with his dinner.
The next morning he saw the goats standing at his front door, knocking on it with their horns.
When he opened up, he thought he heard them bleating "Thank you."
Alfred sighed. He shook his head and patted them on their snouts. "Alright, you dumb goats. Guess I won't cook you yet."

Alfred went about his day wondering why he even takes care of these animals
that give him so much trouble. He realized that they were his only friends
and so he really didn't have many options. That thought still brought a warm
smile to his face and made him appreciate all his little mischeivious
companions a little more.
