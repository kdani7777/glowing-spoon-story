One beautiful summer day on a farm in Kansas, Alfred was milking his cows.
It had been a long day full of monotonous work. Nothing out of the ordinary
had happened and he was simply tired. As the sun went down, Alfred left some
food and water for his animals before he went inside to have dinner. In the
distance, there was a loud rumble.

There were two goats. The two goats tried to cross a narrow bridge over there.
They moved forward but niether of them wanted to make way for the other. They
started fighting, and all of sudden, the bridge is broken.
